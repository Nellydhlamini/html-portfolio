<h1>The Best Series According To Nelly</h1>
<h2>My top 3 series of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>I just absolutely love this childhood favourite because of how vulnerable it is and how much it plays on being 
    kind to others and that everybody deserves love and family, even if they aren't socially deemed as attractive</p>
<h3>Game Of Thrones</h3>
<p>I'm not a bit movie watcher so this series is the best series I've watched in a very long time. It has all the thrills
    suspense and chills, it has a lot of learning curves and i absolutely love it.</p>
<h3>Ozarks</h3>
